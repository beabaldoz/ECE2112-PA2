# import numpy as np - import Numpy library because it'll be required when creating codes that needs functions that are in the Numpy library

# NORMALIZATION PROBLEM - Normalization is one of the most basic preprocessing techniques in data analytics. This involves centering and scaling process. Centering means subtracting the data from the mean and scaling means dividing with its standard deviation. In this problem, create a random 5 x 5 ndarray and store it to variable X. Normalize X.
# np.random.rand(x,x) - generates a (-size) array with random values between 0-1
# mean_x and std_X represents the mean and standard deviation
# I used the formula Z=(X - mean_X)/std_X to compute for the mean and standard deviation of the array

# DIVISIBLE BY 3 PROBLEM - Create a 10x10 ndarray which are the squares of the first 100 integers
# np.arange - generates an array filled with integers from 1-101
# sqr = integers**2 - to get the square of the integers
# sqr.reshape - I reshaped the array in a 10x10 matrix
